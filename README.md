The purpose of this project is to create a website that includes the menu of one store, with the
possibility of saving user’s favourite meals by using a free public api to fetch the meals of this
store. (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
The basic features of this single page application will be the following:
- Navigation bar including all website states( Home, Menu, My Favourites, Meal Generator,
About Me )
- Store home page, which leads you either to the menu, either to user’s favourites or the
random meal generator.
- About me page with personal comments and information.
- Menu page, which lists meal categories.
- Meals page, based on one chosen category. A meal of this list should have the following
details provided: image, name and a feature to add/remove meal from user’s favourites list.
- Favorite Meals page, which includes all the meals the user has added in his favorites’ list,
with image and name plus the ability to remove meals from the list.
- Random meal generator page that generates a random meal for the user to favourite or not.
